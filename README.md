## Licensing
Even though I'm providing this code under the MIT license, [Qt](https://www.qt.io) is used for the
UI component, meaning you'll be bound to its GPL/LGPL license (more info
[here](https://www.qt.io/licensing/open-source-lgpl-obligations)).

I'm not an expert on these things, so be advised.
