## Development
Note: Best to work on a virtual environment.
This page doesn't go into how to do that.

Install `pip-tools`:
```
python -m pip install pip-tools
```

## Licensing
Even though I'm providing this code under the MIT license, [QT](https://www.qt.io) is used for the UI component, meaning
you'll be bound to its GPL/LGPL license (more info [here](https://www.qt.io/licensing/open-source-lgpl-obligations)).

I'm not an expert on these things, so be advised.
